3b.py:
Python source module that provides the main functionality of our program. To execute, we create a symlink
to 3b.py called lab3b and execute that way. This source file audits for Block Consistency, I-Node Allocation,
and Directory Consistency.

Makefile:
Builds and runs our deliverable program. Since this is a Python script that does not require compilation,
our default target creates a symlink called lab3b which executes 3b.py when run. The clean target
deletes all makefield-created targets. The dist target builds our tarball to submit the lab.

README:
This nifty little document that you're reading right now. Has smol descriptions about the submitted files
for this project.
